### Why, hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rob LeCheminant. Let me tell you a little about myself! </br></br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science and Computer Science through Lambda School and am nearly done. I've had ups and downs but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Learning this subject has been absolutely enjoyable and I can't wait to get started on a long career in software, data, and machine learning / AI! </br></br>

ðŸ‘¯ I am a great collaborator on projects because I know how to communicate, especially when I'm not getting something. Communication can make or break a project and I'm willing to put in the work to make it happen. I'm interested in most every facet of the data science world and I'm happy to start anywhere with it. I want to learn it all (though I recognize that's virtually impossible, it's worth a shot, right?)! I have long term goals in building better educational tools to help set teachers free to do excellent work and not get bogged down in grading, metrics, reports, etc. Ask me about it sometime! 

âš¡ Fun fact: Aside from coding, I love composing and playing music. You can <a href="https://lanarchiste.bandcamp.com">check it out here!</a>
